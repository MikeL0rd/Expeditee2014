If you're not at the uni and you want to connect to a server running on a uni machine, most likely you'll need to SSH tunnel to access it.
This doesn't work for UDP connections (such as FrameShare).
You could use netcat (or bash and the virtual files in /dev/tcp and /dev/udp) to pipe data from a UDP to TCP, then back to UDP again on the other end of the SSH tunnel, but I couldn't get that working (and good luck trying to do it on Windows).

So, I wrote a little java program to deal with it:

Scripts for Expeditee are in dev/bin/script

Edit "Frameshare-SSH-Tunnel-CONFIG.sh" to set the server port, SSH username and host
Run "Frameshare-SSH-Tunnel-Client.sh" on the machine that you're running the Expeditee window on
Run "Frameshare-SSH-Tunnel-Server.sh" on the machine that the Expeditee frameserver is running on (only needs to be run once and it should support all users)
